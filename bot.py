Yo yo yo! Welcome to SPIS 2020. I'm **Picobot**, an automated bot here to help you with all things related to the SPIS 2020 Discord!

For now, I'm here to help onboard you to the SPIS 2020 Discord server. Before you can get started and hang out with everyone else, I need to know who you are first. Then I'll introduce you to all the different parts of the Discord server.

If you need help at any point, just text me the word `/helpme` (with the slash!) and a mentor will come and help you. In case this bot breaks or you want to contact us directly, feel free to email any one of the mentors (our emails are on the SPIS People page).

With that being said, let's get started!
