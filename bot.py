For now, I'm here to help welcome you to the SPIS 2020 Discord server. You'll notice that as of right now, you can't type in any of the channels. Don't worry; this is so that we can protect ourselves against random people from joining our server, and so that we can verify who you are before you can talk in the Discord. Before you can get started and hang out with everyone else, I need to know who you are first.

If you need help at any point, just text me the word `/helpme` (with the slash!) and a mentor will come and help you. In case this bot breaks or you want to contact us directly, feel free to email any one of the mentors (our emails are on the SPIS People page).

Congrats! You've finished the first-time setup. It's nice to meet you, {state['student_map'][message.author.id].preferred_name} :)

Now that we've verified who you are, you now have access to all of the different text and voice chats in the Discord server. Eventually, we'll be showing you how to use all these different parts of the server through live walkthroughs and write-ups.

For now, you should read through the different informational text channels we have on the server:

- `#discord-info` has more information on what each of the channels in the Discord server are for.
- `#announcements` contains SPIS-wide announcements regarding assignment deadlines and other urgent info.
- `#useful-links` contains links to useful resources, e.g. the SPIS website and Piazza pages.

Beyond that, all there is to do now is to *jump in and start getting to know your mentors and your fellow mentees!* Our general text chat for hanging out is (appropriately) called `#hanging-out`, so hop on and introduce yourself!

Have fun, and welcome to SPIS!
